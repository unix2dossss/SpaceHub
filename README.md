# 🚀 SpaceHub Website 🌌
Welcome to the SpaceHub website repository! This React project is aimed at creating a dynamic and informative website for SpaceHub, a University Club dedicated to all things space-related.

The SpaceHub website serves as a central hub for information about our club, events, and resources. It provides a platform for both current and prospective members to learn about upcoming activities, access resources, and connect with the SpaceHub community. Our goal is to create an engaging and user-friendly website that reflects the dynamic nature of our club and encourages participation from students interested in space exploration.

## About SpaceHub 🪐
SpaceHub is a supportive community for students interested in space, offering discussions, events, and access to industry insights, with past members advancing to careers in companies like Rocket Lab and pursuing astrophysics PhDs.
